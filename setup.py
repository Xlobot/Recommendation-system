# prompt: ValueError: book_pivot has 899 features, but NearestNeighbors is expecting 888 features as input. i want fix this error

# You need to make sure that the number of features in `book_pivot` matches the number of features used when fitting the `NearestNeighbors` model.
# The error suggests that `book_pivot` currently has 899 features, but the model was fitted on data with 888 features.
# This can happen if the data used for fitting the model was different from the data being passed to `kneighbors`.
# Since you are fitting the model and then immediately using `kneighbors` on the `book_pivot`, the most likely issue is that the `book_pivot` was modified or filtered after fitting the model.

# To fix this, ensure that the `book_pivot` DataFrame used for fitting and predicting has the same number of columns (features).
# Based on your code, the fitting and prediction are done sequentially on the same `book_pivot` variable.
# A possible reason for the discrepancy could be if the `book_pivot` was re-calculated or filtered between the `model.fit()` and `model.kneighbors()` calls, which doesn't seem to be the case here based on the provided code.

# However, let's double-check the dimensions just before fitting and predicting to ensure consistency.
# It's also good practice to use the *same* data (or a consistent view of it) for fitting and prediction.
# Since you are predicting for a single row (`book_pivot.iloc[237,:]`), make sure this row is part of the data used for fitting.

# Let's print the shapes before fitting and before the prediction to confirm.

print("Shape of book_sparse before fitting:", book_sparse.shape)

model = NearestNeighbors(algorithm= 'brute')
model.fit(book_sparse)

# Ensure that the row you are predicting for has the same number of features as the data used for fitting.
print("Shape of the input row for prediction:", book_pivot.iloc[237,:].values.reshape(1,-1).shape)

# If these shapes are different, the issue lies in how `book_pivot` or the slice `book_pivot.iloc[237,:]` is being handled or if `book_pivot` was somehow altered.
# If the shapes are the same at this point, the error might be related to internal indexing or handling within `NearestNeighbors`.
# However, given the error message, the most direct cause is a mismatch in the number of features.

# A common cause of such errors, if not a code logic issue, can be related to the data loading and processing steps if they are not completely deterministic or if there are external factors affecting the data between runs.
# Since the provided code looks logically sound for sequential fit and predict, let's consider if there might be subtle differences in the `final_rating` or `book_pivot` that lead to varying column counts.

# If the error persists even after confirming the shapes are the same just before `fit` and `kneighbors`, it might point to a more complex issue with the data or the library version.

# For now, the best approach is to:
# 1. Verify the shapes of `book_sparse` and `book_pivot.iloc[237,:].values.reshape(1,-1)` right before the `kneighbors` call.
# 2. Ensure that the data used to create `book_sparse` is exactly the same data you are using to create the input for `kneighbors`.

# Given the code, this looks correct, so it's possible there's a subtle data difference or an environment issue causing the column count to vary.
# If the shapes are indeed the same, and the error still occurs, you might need to inspect the `book_pivot` more closely or consider re-running the notebook from scratch to rule out intermediate state issues.

# Assuming the issue is a transient state or a data inconsistency leading to differing column counts, the code itself appears to be structured correctly for sequential fit and prediction. The fix involves ensuring the input to `kneighbors` has the same feature dimension as the data used to fit the model. If your code as presented is run sequentially, this should naturally happen. The error suggests it's not.

# Let's add a more explicit check just before the prediction call.

if book_sparse.shape[1] != book_pivot.iloc[237,:].values.reshape(1,-1).shape[1]:
    print(f"Feature count mismatch! Model expects {book_sparse.shape[1]} features, but input has {book_pivot.iloc[237,:].values.reshape(1,-1).shape[1]} features.")
    # You might want to add more debugging here, like inspecting the columns of book_pivot
    # Or re-create book_pivot right before prediction if you suspect it's being modified.

    distance, suggestion = model.kneighbors(book_pivot.iloc[237,:].values.reshape(1,-1), n_neighbors=6 )
    print("Prediction successful.")
    print("Distance:", distance)
    print("Suggestion:", suggestion)

# If the `Feature count mismatch!` message appears, investigate how `book_pivot` might be changing between the `model.fit()` and `model.kneighbors()` calls, although based on the code, this shouldn't be happening.
# If the message doesn't appear and you still get the ValueError, there might be an issue with the `NearestNeighbors` implementation or the data format itself (e.g., sparse matrix issues). In that case, checking library versions might be helpful.
